# fuzzy_Inverted_pendulum
Basically, this project consists of an inverted pendulum simulator and a fuzzy controller. The main goal was to develop a simple yet useful simulator to model the environment, so that you are enabled to easily create a fuzzy controller for the inverted pendulum problem. It was implemented using pygame and pyfuzzy in python2.7.
inverted pendulum fuzzy control python code implemented controller.py

We have 3 general functions for 3 main steps: fuzzification function 1 In this function the input is received and given by the given figures and the calculation of the line equation We each calculate the function of their belonging to the fuzzy set. pa: REAL; (* description = 'pendulum angle', min = 0, max = 360, unit = 'degrees' ) pv: REAL; ( description = 'pendulum angular velocity', min = - 200, max = 200, unit = 'degrees per second' *) The output of this function is 15 functions belonging to pa and pv. [up_more_right, up_right, up, up_left, up_more_left, down_more_left, do wn_left, down, down_right, down_more_right] [cw_fast_pv, cw_slow_pv, stop_pv, ccw_slow_pv, ccw_fast_pv] inference function 2 In this function, 15 outputs of the previous function are given as input. Using the 43 rules mentioned 5 lists of the output belonging function of these 43 rules as power We set the fuzzy belonging set to force and give it a maximum of 5 lists of belonging functions Return the output title. function 3 Using the 5 inputs of the center of mass function of the shape resulting from the collision of this maximum We get the inputs and the fuzzy force set by the integration method and get it We return in the form of output force
